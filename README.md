Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a psychiatric disease with tenacious patterns of attention, impulsivity behaviour and hyperactivity behaviour among children.
It is important to diagnose and treat the disorder at a young age so that the symptoms do not persist into adulthood.
Brain activity is needed to be considered while identifying ADHD. So, our study explores two techniques, EEG(Electroencephalogram) and fMRI(Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging).
EEG is a helpful technique that sheds light on brain activity in the background and measures the neural substrates of cognition and behavior.
EEG measures the electrical activity of the brain using electrodes placed on the scalp. 
fMRI measures changes in blood flow and oxygenation in the brain, providing information about brain activity during different tasks or at rest.

our aim is to build a robust system which considers both EEG and fMRI data of subjects to detect ADHD.

Datasets:
EEG datasets:
we used EEG dataset provided in IEEE dataport.This dataset consists of 6 NON ADHD subjects and 4 ADHD subjects. Each subject has EEG keyboard and EEG emotiv datasets.
fMRI dataset:
We used ADHD-200 dataset of NYU(New York University) provided in NITRC website under 1000 Functional projects program.
